                      HTTP


    HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1
 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2






                                   HTTP 1.1
1.It use works on the textual format.	
2.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
3.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
4.It compresses data by itself.
                                   HTTP 2	
1.It works on the binary protocol.
2.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
4.It uses HPACK for data compression.



QUESTION NO 2: OBJECTAND IT'S INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT


   Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
 These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 
in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types,
 in the form of “key: value” pairs.
 These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
